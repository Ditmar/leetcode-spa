# 📝 SignUpPage - Registration Page

The `SignUpPage` component is the main interface for new user registration on the platform.

## ⚠️ Important Note: Implementation as "Skeleton" (DEV Build)

It is crucial to understand that this implementation of `SignUpPage` has been intentionally developed as a **"skeleton" (or "scaffolding")**.

### Reason for this Approach (Pending Dependencies)

The `SignUpPage` ticket has direct dependencies on three other shared UI components that belong to different tickets and, at the time of this development, **have not yet been integrated (merged) into the `master` branch**.

These components are:

1.  `Logo` (to display the company logo).
2.  `FormInput` (for the email, username, and password fields).
3.  `PrimaryButton` (for the registration button).

### Solution: Local Placeholders (Fallbacks)

Following the project guidelines for managing pending dependencies ("just build the skeleton"), this component **DOES NOT** attempt to import non-existent components.

Instead, `SignUpPage.tsx` **defines local 'Fallback' (placeholder) versions** of these three components. To address code review feedback on accessibility, these fallbacks use **semantic MUI components** (like `<Button>` and `<Box component="input">`) instead of simple `<div>` elements. This ensures the page is accessible and testable, while still occupying the exact layout space.

### What does this approach enable?

This "skeleton" approach allows `SignUpPage` to be a complete and functional component in itself, enabling:

1.  **Isolated Development:** Develop all state logic (`useState` for inputs) and validations (`handleSubmit`).
2.  **Visual Testing:** Render the complete page in Storybook (`SignUpPage.stories.tsx`) to verify layout, responsiveness, and styles.
3.  **Exact Positioning:** The styles in `SignUpPage.styles.ts` use the placeholders to absolutely position every element (inputs, button, logo, texts) based on the Figma coordinates.
4.  **Unit Testing:** The tests (`SignUpPage.test.tsx`) can verify the complete form validation logic (e.g., showing error messages on an empty submit) and user interaction.

When the real components (`Logo`, `FormInput`, `PrimaryButton`) become available in `master`, the final integration will be as simple as removing the local fallbacks and changing the imports.

## 🎯 Purpose and Features (Implemented Logic)

### Purpose

- Manage user registration using **email**, **username**, and **password**.
- Validate data input in real-time (length, email format).
- Provide **social authentication** options (Google, GitHub, Facebook).
- Display a **loading spinner** (via the `loading` prop) while processing information.

### ✨ Features

- Input fields (placeholders) for **Email**, **Username**, and **Password**.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is 100% fluid and adapts to any screen size, maintaining the proportions defined in the Figma design.
- **Local validation logic** that checks email format, non-empty username, and password length before calling `onSubmit`.
- Loading functionality that disables the button (logic in `isDisabled`) while the form is submitting.
- Inclusion of social login icons for **Google**, **GitHub**, and **Facebook**.
- **Navigation links** to the Login page and legal policies (Terms of Service and Privacy Policy).

## ⚙️ Component Props (API)

| Prop                | Type             | Description                                              |
| :------------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loading`           | `boolean`        | Shows loading spinner and disables the button.           |
| `buttonText`        | `string`         | Text for the registration button.                        |
| `disabled`          | `boolean`        | Disables the button (independent of `loading`).          |
| `onSubmit`          | `(data) => void` | Callback on form submission (only if validation passes). |
| `loginText`         | `string`         | Text for the "Log In" link.                              |
| `signupWithText`    | `string`         | Text displayed above the social auth icons.              |
| `showSocialIcons`   | `boolean`        | Shows or hides the social icons.                         |
| `showLegalText`     | `boolean`        | Shows or hides the reCAPTCHA legal text.                 |
| `googleLoginUrl`    | `string`         | Redirect URL for Google login.                           |
| `githubLoginUrl`    | `string`         | Redirect URL for GitHub login.                           |
| `facebookLoginUrl`  | `string`         | Redirect URL for Facebook login.                         |
| `privacyPolicyUrl`  | `string`         | URL for the Privacy Policy.                              |
| `termsOfServiceUrl` | `string`         | URL for the Terms of Service.                            |

## 🧩 Additional Implementation Details

- **Styling:** Styles are managed entirely with MUI (`sx`) via `SignUpPage.styles.ts`. The layout is **fully responsive** and scalable, using percentages (`percentW`, `percentH`) calculated from the exact Figma design dimensions (`GEOMETRY_PX`), adhering to the "no hardcoded px" guideline.

- **Icon Handling (Assets):** The social icons (Google, GitHub, Facebook) are imported using Vite's `?url` suffix to get the asset URL. A `handleImgError` function is included as a _fallback_ mechanism in case the primary URL fails, attempting to load the assets from alternative paths (e.g., `/assets/google.svg`).

- **Testing:** The tests (`SignUpPage.test.tsx`) are configured to validate the component's **behavioral logic**. They simulate user input, trigger form submission, and verify that the correct validation error messages are displayed or that `onSubmit` is called appropriately, adhering to best practices.
