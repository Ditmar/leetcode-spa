# Dashboard Page

The **DashboardPage** is the main component of the application, displaying user information, recent tests, statistics, and the leaderboard.

## Integrated Components

- **Logo**: Displays the application's logo.
- **AvatarMenu**: User menu with avatar and options such as Profile and Log Out.
- **SearchBar**: Search bar with debounce functionality.
- **TestCard**: Card that shows information about each test.
- **UpcomingQuizCard**: Card showing upcoming quizzes.
- **StatsCard**: Displays statistics like number of tests taken and overall average.
- **DonutProgress**: Circular progress chart representing percentages.
- **LeaderboardPage**: Leaderboard table (mocked for testing purposes).

## Navigation

The dashboard includes a sidebar on desktop and a drawer menu on mobile, allowing access to:

- Tests
- Dashboard
- Courses
- Profile
- Leaderboard
- Dark Mode
- Settings
- Log Out

## Responsive Design

The layout adapts to mobile screens using `useMediaQuery` and `theme.breakpoints`. Many components use the `isMobile` prop to adjust styles such as position, size, and alignment.

## Tests

During development, heavy components like **LeaderboardPage** have been mocked, and test data has been used for cards and statistics. It's recommended to update the tests and mocks when integrating with the real backend.

## Notifications

A notification icon is displayed on desktop. Clicking it shows a notice with the number of pending user actions.
