 LoginPage - Authentication Page
The `LoginPage` component is the primary interface for users to **authenticate** and access the platform.

## Important Note: Implementation as "Skeleton" (DEV Build)
It is crucial to understand that this implementation of `LoginPage` has been intentionally developed as a **"skeleton" (or "scaffolding")**.
### Reason for this Approach (Pending Dependencies)
The `LoginPage` ticket has direct dependencies on three other shared UI components that belong to different tickets and, at the time of this development, **have not yet been integrated (merged) into the `master` branch**.
These components are:1.  `Logo` (to display the company logo).2.  `FormInput` (for the email/username and password fields).3.  `PrimaryButton` (for the login button).
### Solution: Local Placeholders (Fallbacks)
Following the project guidelines for managing pending dependencies ("just build the skeleton"), this component **DOES NOT** attempt to import non-existent components.
Instead, `LoginPage.tsx` **defines local 'Fallback' (placeholder) versions** of these three components. To address code review feedback on accessibility, these fallbacks use **semantic MUI components** (like `<Button>` and `<Box component="input">`) instead of simple `<div>` elements. This ensures the page is accessible and testable, while still occupying the exact layout space.
### What does this approach enable?
This "skeleton" approach allows `LoginPage` to be a complete and functional component in itself, enabling:1.  **Isolated Development:** Develop all state logic (`useState` for inputs) and validations (`handleSubmit`).2.  **Visual Testing:** Render the complete page in Storybook (`LoginPage.stories.tsx`) to verify layout, responsiveness, and styles.3.  **Exact Positioning:** The styles in `LoginPage.styles.ts` use the placeholders to absolutely position every element (inputs, button, logo, texts) based on the Figma coordinates.4.  **Unit Testing:** The tests (`LoginPage.test.tsx`) can verify the complete form validation logic (e.g., showing error messages on an empty submit) and user interaction.
When the real components (`Logo`, `FormInput`, `PrimaryButton`) become available in `master`, the final integration will be as simple as removing the local fallbacks and changing the imports.

## Purpose and Features (Implemented Logic)
### Purpose
- Manage user login using **email/username** and **password**.- Validate data input in real-time (non-empty fields).- Provide **social authentication** options (Google, GitHub, Facebook).- Display a **loading spinner** (via the `loading` prop) while processing information.
### Features
- Input fields (placeholders) for **Email/Username** and **Password**.- **Responsive Design:** The layout is 100% fluid and adapts to any screen size, maintaining the proportions defined in the Figma design.- **Local validation logic** that checks for non-empty fields before calling `onSubmit`.- Loading functionality that disables the button (logic in `isDisabled`) while the form is submitting.- Inclusion of social login icons for **Google**, **GitHub**, and **Facebook**.- **Navigation links** to the "Forgot Password" and "Sign Up" pages, and legal policies (Terms of Service and Privacy Policy).
