# TestCard Component Documentation

The `TestCard` component is a flexible and reusable card component built with **React** and **MUI**. It is designed to display a logo, title, and description in a visually appealing way while keeping accessibility and maintainability in mind.

## Features

- **Layouts**: Supports both `horizontal` and `vertical` layouts.
- **Logo support**: Accepts a string (image URL) or a React node as a logo.
- **Text content**: Displays a title and description. Long text is truncated or wrapped to prevent layout breaking.
- **Centralized styling**: All sizes, paddings, and gaps are defined in `TestCard.constants.ts` and applied consistently via `TestCard.styles.ts`.
- **Hover and interaction effects**: Supports hover transformations and shadows via the `sx` prop.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Fully navigable by keyboard using `tabIndex={0}`.
  - `role="button"` is applied to the interactive area.
  - Supports activation via `Enter` or `Space` keys.
- **Event handling**: `onSelect` is compatible with mouse clicks and keyboard events.
- **ForwardRef support**: The DOM element can be accessed externally via `ref`.

## Testing

- Uses **Vitest** and **@testing-library/react** for automated testing.
- User interactions are simulated using `user-event`.
- Tests cover:
  - Mouse and keyboard activation.
  - Horizontal and vertical layouts.
  - Logo as string or React node.
  - Handling of long text content.
  - Proper rendering of all visual elements.

## Storybook

- Includes multiple stories demonstrating:
  - Basic card.
  - Horizontal and vertical layouts.
  - Hover effects.
  - Interactive click actions.
  - Long text content.
  - Cards without images.
  - Shadowed cards.
- Stories are isolated, self-contained, and reflect actual component behavior.

## Notes

- All constants for sizing, padding, and logo dimensions are defined in `TestCard.constants.ts`.
- Styles are centralized in `TestCard.styles.ts` to avoid magic numbers and maintain consistency.
- The component fully respects incoming `sx` props while merging them with default styles.
- ForwardRef allows advanced use cases, such as external animations or measurements.
