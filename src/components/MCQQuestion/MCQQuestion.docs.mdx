# 🧩 MCQQuestion

The **MCQQuestion** component represents a multiple-choice question.
It allows the user to select a single answer from several available options.
It is designed to be reusable, accessible, and easily integrated into assessment environments or interactive questionnaires.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of the component is to offer a standardized way of displaying multiple-choice questions within an exam system, survey, or educational form.

It is developed following the **Component-Driven Development** approach, which guarantees:

- Clear separation of responsibilities.
- Ease of testing and maintenance.
- Reuse in different contexts (Storybook, production, testing, etc.).
- Compliance with accessibility standards (WAI-ARIA).

---

## ⚙️ Props

The component receives the following properties:

- **question**: The main text of the question to display.
- **options**: The list of available options to select.

Each option has a `label` (visible text) and a `value` (an associated internal value).

- **selectedValue** _(optional)_: The currently selected value.

If provided, the component operates in **controlled** mode.

- **onChange**: The function executed when the user selects an option.

Returns the value of the selected option.

- **number** _(optional)_: The number or index of the question. Displayed before the text (for example, “1.”).
- **disabled** _(optional)_: Disables all options and prevents user interaction.

## 🧱 Component Structure

The component is divided into several files to maintain a modular and scalable architecture:

- `MCQQuestion.tsx`: Main logic and rendering of the component.
- `MCQQuestion.styles.ts`: Custom styles using the MUI Styled API.
- `MCQQuestion.types.ts`: Strict typing with TypeScript.
- `MCQQuestion.stories.tsx`: Storybook stories for visualization.
- `MCQQuestion.test.tsx`: Unit tests with the React Testing Library and Vitest.

---

## 🎨 Design and Styles

The design is based on **Material UI (MUI)**. Fonts (Montserrat, Syne) must be imported globally via the theme.

Design Features:

- Vertical layout with even spacing.
- Use of a grid to organize options responsibly.
- Colors consistent with the overall theme.
- A clean appearance.
- Responsive styling that automatically adapts to small screens.

Internal visual structure:

```
<QuestionContainer>
<QuestionText> (with optional number)
<RadioGroup>
<OptionsGrid>
<StyledFormControlLabel> (an option with its radio)
```

---

## ♿ Accessibility (A11y)

The component complies with **WAI-ARIA** accessibility standards, ensuring that it is usable by all users, including those using assistive technologies.

Accessibility Features:

- Use of semantic roles (`radiogroup`, `radio`).
- `aria-labelledby`, `aria-checked`, and `aria-disabled` attributes.
- Full support for keyboard navigation.
- Appropriate semantic structure (`FormLabel`, `fieldset`, `legend`).
- Predictable and consistent behavior for screen readers.

---

## 🧪 Unit Tests

The component is covered by unit tests using the **React Testing Library** and **Vitest**.
The tests verify the following behaviors:

- Correct rendering of the question text and options.

- Execution of the `onChange` function when an option is selected.
- Updating the state controlled by the `selectedValue` prop.
- Disabled state when `disabled` is `true`.
- Validation of ARIA roles and attributes for accessibility.
- Correct handling of long or multi-line text.

These tests ensure that the component is reliable, accessible, and behaves consistently when state and prop changes occur.

---

## 📘 Usage Example

```tsx
<MCQQuestion
  number={1}
  question="Which of the following is a programming language?"
  options={[
    { label: 'HTML', value: 'html' },
    { label: 'Python', value: 'python' },
    { label: 'CSS', value: 'css' },
  ]}
  onChange={(value) => console.log('Selected:', value)}
/>
```

This example shows a basic use of the component in an assessment or form context.

---

## 🧰 Use in Storybook

The component has different stories in Storybook to display its variants:

- **Default:** Normal and interactive state.
- **Disabled:** Disabled version, no interaction possible.
- **LongQuestion:** Example with long question text.
- **MobileLayout:** View adapted to small screens (320px).

These stories allow you to visually validate the component's design, behavior, and accessibility before integrating it into production.
