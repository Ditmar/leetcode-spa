# 📊 StatsPanel

The **StatsPanel** component provides a concise summary of test statistics such as total, passed, failed, and waiting results.  
It presents the data visually with icons and colors to deliver an instant understanding of test performance and progress.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The **StatsPanel** offers a clear and consistent way to display aggregated statistics in dashboards or evaluation panels.  
It is built with **Material UI (MUI)** and designed following the **Component-Driven Development (CDD)** approach.

**Core principles:**
- ✅ Clear visual distinction between statistics.  
- 🔁 Reusable and easy to theme.  
- ♿ Accessible and screen-reader friendly.  
- 🧩 Fully typed with TypeScript for safety and maintainability.

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|

| `passed` | `number` | Number of tests that passed successfully. |
| `failed` | `number` | Number of tests that failed. |

## 🧱 Structure

The component is modular and easy to maintain:

- **StatsPanel.tsx** — Core component logic and rendering.  
- **StatsPanel.hook.ts** — Handles internal data calculations.  
- **StatsPanel.styles.ts** — Contains all style definitions.  
- **StatsPanel.types.ts** — Strict TypeScript typing.  
- **StatsPanel.constants.ts** — Icons, labels, and color mappings.  
- **StatsPanel.stories.tsx** — Storybook stories and demos.

---

## 🎨 Design

Each statistic card includes:
- An **icon** (custom SVG or MUI icon).  
- A **number** showing the value.  
- A **label** describing the metric.  

**Visual highlights:**
- Distinct colors for each category (passed, failed, waiting).  
- Modern, responsive card layout.  
- Matches your MUI theme for brand consistency.

## 🧩 Custom Icons

You can use **custom SVG icons** exported from Figma or any design tool.  
Simply add them to your assets folder and assign them to each statistic.  
They will automatically adapt to MUI’s color and size settings for a consistent look.

---

## 💡 Example

A typical `StatsPanel` might show:
- ✅ 45 Passed  
- ❌ 10 Failed  
- ⏳ 5 Waiting  

This gives users a quick and intuitive overview of overall performance.

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Keep icon styles consistent.  
- Use semantic colors (green for success, red for error, yellow for waiting).  
- Maintain high contrast for accessibility.  
- Ensure responsiveness across screen sizes.
